## Wondering why your kernel crashes on Jupyter? Cant seem to install packages with pip? Perhaps my experience helps

I upgraded my laptop to the new Apple M1 a year after it was released, thinking wishfully that the software compatibility side of things would have been died down. Little did I know what I was up against. 

After I got my brand new PC, I set out to do the usual stuff, installing Python, anaconda, virtual environments and the whole shebang. It seemed to be on the face of it, even though installing a few packages was an issue, it wasnt something that couldnt solved past a few google searches. 

 So I install jupyter notebook and with a lot of pain, install tensorflow and write the first line of code: 

*import tensorflow as tf *
