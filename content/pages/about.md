I was born in India and after graduating in Engineering from JNTU  and securing 99.69% in CAT, I enrolled myself for an MBA . As part of my MBA I moved to Madrid where i also found a job after graduation.  Eventually I moved to Berlin, Germany where I have lived for the last 10 years and in the process I became a German citizen.

Professionally I work as the Director Of Strategy for Dynamic Yield. Prior to this I worked extensively in Consulting, Machine Learning, Analytics & Data Engineering.

If I had to sum up myself it would be the quote above. As a hobby, I explore different worlds, the world of physics, astronomy, history, political science, maths etc.. It is my goal to write down my thoughts on this blog when i am exploring a different world.
