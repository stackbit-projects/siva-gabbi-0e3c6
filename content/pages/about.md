Born in India and after graduated in Engineering.  With a 99.69% in CAT, I enrolled myself for an MBA. As part of my MBA I moved to Madrid where i also found a job after graduation.  Eventually I moved to Berlin, Germany where I have lived for the last 10 years and in the process became a German citizen.

Professionally I work as the Director Of Strategy for Dynamic Yield. Prior to this I worked extensively in Consulting, Machine Learning, Analytics & Data Engineering.

If I had to sum myself up it would be the quote above. 

As a hobby, I explore different worlds, the world of physics, astronomy, programming, history, political science, maths etc.. It is my goal to write down my thoughts on this blog when i am exploring a different world.

*Thank You for reading!*

*I hope knowing things is as exciting to you as it is to me :)*
